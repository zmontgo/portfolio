title: Fahrenheit 451 Review
author: Zachary Montgomery
excerpt: A review of Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury after our book club recently completed
  it.

---
Our book club recently finished Fahrenheit 451, a short novel by Ray Bradbury. Every year, this short novel is purchased and read by millions of students in schools all over the world. However, the reception is not too positive. From boredom to hatred, these students’ responses surprised me. I had read the book the year before I was going to read it in middle school, and I had loved it. And indeed, general reception from our book club seemed overwhelmingly positive. One of the members on our Discord mentioned this, saying,

> "I was iffy on reading Fahrenheit 451 because I remember it being described in high school as “just one of those books that we have to read.” I’m glad I read through it and enjoyed it despite the negative memories I have of people describing it."

Why such a split? I think it has something to do with the intention Bradbury had for the novel.

Fahrenheit 451 is a commentary on censorship. Many people say that Fahrenheit 451 is a novel about the dangers of technology, and while I believe that is a part of the theme, it is _not_ the main one. Along with this is a love for reading that prevails throughout the entire book. (You cannot hate censorship if you do not love what is being censored) So the reason for the divide is that, sadly, many students simply dislike reading. On the other hand, in a book club like ours, there are hundreds of people there who enjoy reading. A love letter only touches those in love. Coincidentally, as we begin reading, we can see Bradbury's fears of a society that has lost its love of reading. It starts with the first of three sections, **The Hearth and the Salamander**. And it opens with the iconic opening:

> It was a pleasure to burn.

Note the highest care given to this sentence. We are in the head of our main character, Montag. He was not saying, "It was a pleasure to burn books." That would carry far too little weight, and in fact, that is not what Montag is _doing_. What he is doing is "playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history.” To Montag, he is burning down more than books. He is burning down what those books stand for.

And he enjoys it.

Dehumanization is "the process of depriving a person or group of positive human qualities.” And dehumanization is precisely what Montag is doing. He is removing the most basic human right, the right to think. In Fahrenheit 451’s world, humans have gone through the hearth and returned as a salamander.

Later that night, Montag meets Clarisse. Again, the attention to detail astounds me. What stood out to me was the description of her eyes. Here we find the first refreshing imagery in the novel, “He saw himself in her eyes, suspended in two shining drops of bright water.” Heretofore fire was prevalent in Bradbury's descriptions. And like water, enough can quench flames, but too little and it will be up in steam, without a trace.
