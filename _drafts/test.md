title: Fahrenheit 451 Review
author: Zachary Montgomery
excerpt: A review of Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury after our book club recently completed
  it.

---
Our book club recently finished Fahrenheit 451, a short novel by Ray Bradbury. This book is read by millions of students in America's schooling system every year, and the reception is not too positive. Ranging from boredom to hatred, the varied responses of these students surprised me. I had read the book the year before I was going to read it in middle school, and I had loved it. And indeed, general reception from our book club seemed overwhelmingly positive. One of the members on our Discord mentioned this, saying, "I was iffy on reading Fahrenheit 451 because I remember it being described in high school as “just one of those books that we have to read.” I’m glad I read through it and enjoyed it despite the negative memories I have of people describing it." Why such a split? I think it has something to do with the intention Bradbury had for the novel.

Fahrenheit 451 is a letter of adoration to books. Many people say that Fahrenheit 451 is a novel about the dangers of technology, and while I believe that is a part of the theme, it is _not_ the main one. Sadly, many students dislike reading. On the other hand, in a book club like ours, there are hundreds of people there who enjoy reading. This, I believe, is the reason for the divide. Coincidentally, as we begin reading, we can see Bradbury's fears of a society that has lost its love of reading. It begins with the first of three sections, **The Hearth and the Salamander**. And it opens with the iconic opening:

> It was a pleasure to burn.

Note the greatest care given to this sentence. Montag, our main character, is speaking. He did not say, "It was a pleasure to burn books." That would carry far too little weight, and in fact, that is not what Montag is _doing_. What he is doing is "playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history". To Montag, he is burning down more than books, he is burning down what they stand for. And he enjoys it. Dehumanization is "the process of depriving a person or group of positive human qualities". This is precisely what Montag is doing. He is removing the most basic human right, the right to think. In this world, humans have gone through the hearth and returned as a salamander.

Later that night, Montag meets Clarisse. Again, the attention to detail astounds me. What stood out to me was the description of her eyes. They are described as drops of water, the only refreshing imagery we have thus far. Heretofore fire was prevalent in Bradbury's descriptions. And like water, enough can quench flames, but too little and it will be evaporated without a trace.
