## It's Simple
We collect no data that could personally recognize you. All we record is a hit count, which means every time you visit our site, a number goes up by one. This lets us know how often our site is being used. We don't use any tracking or analytics of any kind.

If you sign up for our mailing list, you agree to give us some of you personal information. We treat this with utmost security, and encrypt it, storing it in a password-secured database. We never personally access this personal information and we never sell it. If you want to unsubscribe, all record of your personal information is deleted.
