# Privacy Policy

## (Without the Legal Mumbo-Jumbo)
*It's simple. We collect no data that could personally recognize you.*

All we record is simple info about how we use the site, including what pages you visit, how long you stay on the site, where you found us from, and other general information. We make your IP anonymous by setting the last two groups to all zeros, and using randomly assigned IDs to remember you without knowing who you are. Privacy is of the upmost importance to us, and so all we collect is information that could be useful in improving our site.

Because all information we collect is anonymous, there is no way to tie it to you. Because of this, you cannot request to see the data we've collected from you.

If you wish not to let our analytics collect anonymous usage data, you can send a Do Not Track (DNT) request through your browser. We respect this request and won't collect any analytics information from you. However, if you have JavaScript on we will still track you if you don't send a DNT request.

If you sign up for our mailing list, you agree to give us and Mailchimp ([Mailchimp's privacy policy](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/)) some of your personal information including your IP and email address. We will never sell any of this information, and will not use it to track you. In addition, by commenting on a blog post you are sending some of your data to Disqus. We cannot access this information, and if you want to see how Disqus handles your information you may find it in their privacy policy ([Disqus's privacy policy](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717103-disqus-privacy-policy)).
